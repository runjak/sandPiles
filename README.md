# SandPiles

This project aims for three things:

1. I want to explore the [Abelian sandpile model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model) after a video by [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MtEUErz7Gg) got me interested in this.
2. I want to get to know more about flux and how it works together with react.
3. I want to get to know the canvas element and drawing with a 2d context better
   as I discovered that there are some pieces I'm not that familiar with.
